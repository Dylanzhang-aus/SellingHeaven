2. Install instructions

We use PHP language as the main transformation language and cooperate with the front-end Bootstrap to build this website. The IDE we used was Visual Studio Code. So, all you need to do is open our original code locally with VS Code and start compiling. But make sure that the locally calculated PHP version is PHP7.4 or higher. You can also use: php-s localhost: 8000 comment to run the test.
